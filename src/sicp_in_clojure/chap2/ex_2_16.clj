; Another reason algebraic expressions may lead to different answer may be associated with IEEE floating
; point arithmetic. IEEE floating point math is notoriously bad at dealing with decimal arithmetic for
; currency calculations for example. Or the floating point arithmetic can lead to problems where the
; calculations are "ill-conditioned" because of very small or very  large values.
